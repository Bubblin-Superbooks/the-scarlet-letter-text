death, overwhelmed with shame, and standing where Hester Prynne
had stood!</p><p>Carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture, the
minister, unawares, and to his own infinite alarm, burst into a
great peal of laughter.  It was immediately responded to by a
light, airy, childish laugh, in which, with a thrill of the
heart—but he knew not whether of exquisite pain, or pleasure as

suppressing his voice—"Hester!  Hester Prynne!  Are you there?"</p><p>"Yes; it is Hester Prynne!" she replied, in a tone of surprise;
and the minister heard her footsteps approaching from the
side-walk, along which she had been passing.  "It is I, and my
little Pearl."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Whence come you, Hester?" asked the minister. </p></div> </div>
