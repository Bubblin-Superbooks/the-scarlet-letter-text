flashed once in the battle's front, and showed still a bright
gleam along its blade—would have been among the inkstands,
paper-folders, and mahogany rulers on the Deputy Collector's

re-creating the stalwart soldier of the Niagara frontier—the
man of true and simple energy.  It was the recollection of those
memorable words of his—"I'll try, Sir"—spoken on the very
verge of a desperate and heroic enterprise, and breathing the
soul and spirit of New England hardihood, comprehending all
perils, and encountering all.  If, in our country, valour were
rewarded by heraldic honour, this phrase—which it seems so easy
to speak, but which only he, with such a task of danger and
glory before him, has ever spoken—would be the best and fittest
of all mottoes for the General's shield of arms.</p></div> </div>
