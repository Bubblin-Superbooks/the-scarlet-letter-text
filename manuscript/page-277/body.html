window—for it was summer-time—the minister beheld Hester
Prynne and little Pearl passing along the footpath that
traversed the enclosure.  Pearl looked as beautiful as the day,

Isaac Johnson himself—she began to dance upon it.  In reply to
her mother's command and entreaty that she would behave more

a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb.  Taking a handful of
these, she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter
that decorated the maternal bosom, to which the burrs, as their
nature was, tenaciously adhered.  Hester did not pluck them off.</p></div> </div>
