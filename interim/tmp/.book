The\nfirst time was three or four years since, when I favoured the\nreader—inexcusably, and for no earthly reason that either the\nindulgent reader or the intrusive author could imagine—with a\ndescription of my way of life in the deep quietude of an Old\nManse.  And now—because, beyond my deserts, I was happy enough\nto find a listener or two on the former occasion—I again seize\nthe</p>",

The truth\nseems to be, however, that when he casts his leaves forth upon\nthe wind, the author addresses, not the many who will fling\naside his volume, or never take it up, but the few who will\nunderstand him better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates.\nSome authors, indeed, do far more than this, and indulge\nthemselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could\nfittingly be addressed only and exclusively to the one heart and\nmind of perfect sympathy; as if the printed book, thrown at\nlarge on the wide world, were certain to find out the divided\nsegment of the writer's own nature, and complete his circle of\nexistence by bringing him into communion with it.  It is scarcely\ndecorous, however, to speak all, even where we speak\nimpersonally.  But, as thoughts are</p>",

To this extent, and within these\nlimits, an author, methinks, may be autobiographical, without\nviolating either the reader's rights or his own.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It will be seen, likewise, that this Custom-House sketch has a\ncertain propriety, of a kind always recognised in literature, as\nexplaining how a large portion of the following pages came into\nmy possession, and as offering proofs of the authenticity of a\nnarrative therein contained.  This, in fact—a desire to put\nmyself in my true position as editor, or very little more, of\nthe</p>",

Its front is\nornamented with a portico of half-a-dozen wooden pillars,\nsupporting a balcony, beneath which a flight of wide granite\nsteps descends towards the street.  Over the entrance hovers an\nenormous specimen of the American eagle, with outspread wings, a\nshield before her breast, and, if I recollect aright, a bunch of\nintermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each</p>",

With\nthe customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this\nunhappy fowl, she appears by the fierceness of her beak and eye,\nand the general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief\nto the inoffensive community; and especially to warn all\ncitizens careful of their safety against intruding on the\npremises which she overshadows with her wings.  Nevertheless,\nvixenly as she looks, many people are seeking at this very\nmoment to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal\neagle; imagining, I presume, that her bosom has all the softness\nand snugness of an eiderdown pillow.  But she has no great\ntenderness even in her best of moods, and, sooner or\nlater—oftener soon than late—is apt to fling off her nestlings\nwith a scratch of her claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling\nwound from her barbed arrows.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The pavement round about the above-described edifice—which we\nmay as well name at once as the</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Custom-House of the port—has\ngrass enough growing in its chinks to show that it has not, of\nlate days, been worn by any multitudinous resort of business.  In\nsome months of the year, however, there often chances a forenoon\nwhen affairs move onward with a livelier tread.  Such occasions\nmight remind the elderly citizen of that period, before the last\nwar with England, when Salem was a port by itself; not scorned,\nas she is now, by her own merchants and ship-owners, who permit\nher wharves to crumble to ruin while their ventures go to swell,\nneedlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood of commerce at\nNew York or Boston.  On some such morning, when three or four\nvessels happen to have arrived at once usually from Africa or\nSouth America—or to be on the verge of their departure\nthitherward, there is a sound of frequent feet passing briskly\nup and down the granite steps.  Here, before his own wife has\ngreeted him, you may greet the sea-flushed ship-master,</p>",

Here, too, comes his owner, cheerful, sombre, gracious or\nin the sulks, accordingly as his scheme of the now accomplished\nvoyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily be\nturned to gold, or has buried him under a bulk of incommodities\nsuch as nobody will care to rid him of.  Here, likewise—the germ\nof the wrinkle-browed, grizzly-bearded, careworn merchant—we\nhave the smart young clerk, who gets the taste of traffic as a\nwolf-cub does of blood, and already sends adventures in his\nmaster's ships, when he had better be sailing mimic boats upon a\nmill-pond.  Another figure in the scene is the outward-bound\nsailor, in quest of a protection; or the recently arrived one,\npale and feeble, seeking a passport to the hospital.

Oftentimes they were\nasleep, but occasionally might be heard talking together, in\nvoices between a speech and a snore, and with that lack of\nenergy that distinguishes the occupants of alms-houses, and all\nother human beings who depend for subsistence on charity, on\nmonopolized labour, or anything else but their own independent\nexertions.

All three\ngive glimpses of the shops of grocers, block-makers,\nslop-sellers, and ship-chandlers, around the doors of which are\ngenerally to be seen, laughing and gossiping, clusters of old\nsalts, and such other wharf-rats as haunt the Wapping of a\nseaport.  The room itself is cobwebbed, and dingy with old paint;\nits floor is strewn with grey sand, in a fashion that has\nelsewhere fallen into long disuse; and it is easy to conclude,\nfrom the general</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">slovenliness of the place, that this is a\nsanctuary into which womankind, with her tools of magic, the\nbroom and mop, has very infrequent access.  In the way of\nfurniture, there is a stove with a voluminous funnel; an old\npine desk with a three-legged stool beside it; two or three\nwooden-bottom chairs, exceedingly decrepit and infirm; and—not\nto forget the library—on some shelves, a score or two of\nvolumes of the Acts of Congress, and a bulky Digest of the\nRevenue laws.  A tin pipe ascends through the ceiling, and forms\na medium of vocal communication with other parts of the edifice.\nAnd here, some six months ago—pacing from corner to corner, or\nlounging on the long-legged stool, with his elbow on the desk,\nand his eyes wandering up and down the columns of the morning\nnewspaper—you might have recognised, honoured reader, the same\nindividual who welcomed you into his cheery little study, where\nthe sunshine glimmered so</p>",

  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">view of the alms-house at the other—such\nbeing the features of my native town, it would be quite as\nreasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged\nchecker-board.  And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere,\nthere is within me a feeling for Old Salem, which, in lack of a\nbetter phrase, I must be content to call affection.  The\nsentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots\nwhich my family has stuck into the soil.  It is now nearly two\ncenturies and a quarter since the original Briton, the earliest\nemigrant of my name, made his appearance in the wild and\nforest-bordered settlement which has since become a city.  And\nhere his descendants have been born and died, and have mingled\ntheir earthly substance with the soil, until no small portion of\nit must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a\nlittle while, I walk the streets.  In part, therefore, the\nattachment which I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of\ndust for dust. </p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Few of my countrymen can know what it is; nor, as\nfrequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock, need\nthey consider it desirable to know.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But the sentiment has likewise its moral quality.  The figure of\nthat first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and\ndusky grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination as far back\nas I can remember.  It still haunts me, and induces a sort of\nhome-feeling with the past, which I scarcely claim in reference\nto the present phase of the town.  I seem to have a stronger\nclaim to a residence here on account of this grave, bearded,\nsable-cloaked, and steeple-crowned progenitor—who came so\nearly, with his Bible and his sword, and trode the unworn street\nwith such a stately port, and made so large a figure, as a man\nof war and peace—a stronger claim than for myself, whose name\nis seldom heard and my face hardly known.  He was a soldier,\nlegislator, judge; he was a ruler in the Church; he had all</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">the\nPuritanic traits, both good and evil.  He was likewise a bitter\npersecutor; as witness the Quakers, who have remembered him in\ntheir histories, and relate an incident of his hard severity\ntowards a woman of their sect, which will last longer, it is to\nbe feared, than any record of his better deeds, although these\nwere many.  His son, too, inherited the persecuting spirit, and\nmade himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches,\nthat their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon\nhim.  So deep a stain, indeed, that his dry old bones, in the\nCharter-street burial-ground, must still retain it, if they have\nnot crumbled utterly to dust!  I know not whether these ancestors\nof mine bethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon of Heaven\nfor their cruelties; or whether they are now groaning under the\nheavy consequences of them in another state of being.  At all\nevents, I, the present writer, as their representative, hereby\ntake shame upon myself for their</p>",
  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sakes, and pray that any curse\nincurred by them—as I have heard, and as the dreary and\nunprosperous condition of the race, for many a long year back,\nwould argue to exist—may be now and henceforth removed.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Doubtless, however, either of these stern and black-browed\nPuritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution\nfor his sins that, after so long a lapse of years, the old trunk\nof the family tree, with so much venerable moss upon it, should\nhave borne, as its topmost bough, an idler like myself.  No aim\nthat I have ever cherished would they recognise as laudable; no\nsuccess of mine—if my life, beyond its domestic scope, had ever\nbeen brightened by success—would they deem otherwise than\nworthless, if not positively disgraceful.  \"What is he?\" murmurs\none grey shadow of my forefathers to the other.  \"A writer of\nstory books!

Gradually, they have sunk almost out of\nsight; as old houses, here and there about the streets, get\ncovered half-way to the eaves by the accumulation of new soil.\nFrom father to son, for above a hundred years, they followed the\nsea; a</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">grey-headed shipmaster, in each generation, retiring from\nthe quarter-deck to the homestead, while a boy of fourteen took\nthe hereditary place before the mast, confronting the salt spray\nand the gale which had blustered against his sire and grandsire.\nThe boy, also in due time, passed from the forecastle to the\ncabin, spent a tempestuous manhood, and returned from his\nworld-wanderings, to grow old, and die, and mingle his dust with\nthe natal earth.  This long connexion of a family with one spot,\nas its place of birth and burial, creates a kindred between the\nhuman being and the locality, quite independent of any charm in\nthe scenery or moral circumstances that surround him.  It is not\nlove but instinct.  The new inhabitant—who came himself from a\nforeign land, or whose father or grandfather came—has little\nclaim to be called a Salemite; he has no conception of the\noyster-like tenacity with which an old settler, over whom his\nthird century is creeping, clings</p>",
  "page-28": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">to the spot where his\nsuccessive generations have been embedded.  It is no matter that\nthe place is joyless for him; that he is weary of the old wooden\nhouses, the mud and dust, the dead level of site and sentiment,\nthe chill east wind, and the chillest of social\natmospheres;—all these, and whatever faults besides he may see\nor imagine, are nothing to the purpose.  The spell survives, and\njust as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly\nparadise.  So has it been in my case.  I felt it almost as a\ndestiny to make Salem my home; so that the mould of features and\ncast of character which had all along been familiar here—ever,\nas one representative of the race lay down in the grave, another\nassuming, as it were, his sentry-march along the main\nstreet—might still in my little day be seen and recognised in\nthe old town.  Nevertheless, this very sentiment is an evidence\nthat the connexion, which has become an unhealthy one, should at\nlast be severed.  Human nature will not</p>",

My doom was on me.  It\nwas not the first time, nor the second, that I had gone away—as\nit seemed, permanently—but yet returned, like the bad\nhalfpenny, or as if Salem were for me the inevitable centre of\nthe universe.  So, one fine morning I ascended the flight of\ngranite steps, with the President's commission in my pocket, and\nwas introduced to the corps of gentlemen who were to aid me in\nmy weighty responsibility as chief executive officer of</p>",

For\nupwards of twenty years before this epoch, the independent\nposition of the Collector had kept the Salem Custom-House out of\nthe whirlpool of political vicissitude, which makes the tenure\nof office generally so fragile.  A soldier—New England's most\ndistinguished soldier—he stood firmly on the pedestal of his\ngallant services; and, himself secure in the wise liberality of\nthe successive administrations through which he had held office,\nhe had been the safety of his subordinates in many an hour of\ndanger and heart-quake.

Though by no means less liable than their fellow-men\nto age and infirmity, they had evidently some talisman or other\nthat kept death at bay.

His voice and laugh, which perpetually\nre-echoed through the Custom-House, had nothing of the tremulous\nquaver and cackle of an old man's utterance; they came strutting\nout of his lungs, like the crow of a cock, or the blast of a\nclarion.

The original and more potent causes, however, lay in the\nrare perfection of his animal nature, the moderate proportion of\nintellect, and the very trifling admixture of moral and\nspiritual ingredients; these latter qualities, indeed, being in\nbarely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on\nall-fours.  He possessed no power of thought, no depth of\nfeeling, no troublesome sensibilities: nothing, in short, but a\nfew commonplace instincts, which, aided by the cheerful temper\nwhich grew inevitably out of his physical well-being, did duty\nvery respectably, and to general acceptance, in lieu of a heart.\nHe had been the husband of three wives, all long since dead; the\nfather of twenty children, most of whom, at every age of\nchildhood or maturity, had likewise returned to dust.

It was only with the assistance of a\nservant, and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade,\nthat he could slowly and painfully ascend the Custom-House\nsteps, and, with a toilsome progress across the floor, attain\nhis customary chair beside the fireplace.  There he used to sit,\ngazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures\nthat came and went, amid the rustle of papers, the administering\nof oaths, the discussion of business, and the casual talk of the\noffice; all which sounds and circumstances seemed but\nindistinctly to impress his senses, and hardly to make their way\ninto his inner sphere of contemplation.  His countenance, in this\nrepose, was mild and kindly.  If his notice was sought, an\nexpression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his\nfeatures, proving that there was light within him, and that it\nwas only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp</p>",
  "page-48": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that\nobstructed the rays in their passage.  The closer you penetrated\nto the substance of his mind, the sounder it appeared.  When no\nlonger called upon to speak or listen—either of which\noperations cost him an evident effort—his face would briefly\nsubside into its former not uncheerful quietude.  It was not\npainful to behold this look; for, though dim, it had not the\nimbecility of decaying age.

It was marked with the noble and heroic qualities\nwhich showed it to be not a mere accident, but of good right,\nthat he had won a distinguished name.  His spirit could never, I\nconceive, have been characterized by an uneasy activity; it\nmust, at any period of his life, have required an impulse to set\nhim in motion; but once stirred up, with obstacles to overcome,\nand an adequate object to be attained, it was not in the man to\ngive out or fail.  The heat that had formerly pervaded his\nnature, and which was not yet extinct, was never of the kind\nthat flashes and flickers in a blaze; but rather a deep red\nglow, as of iron in a furnace.

But I\ncould imagine, even then, that, under some excitement which\nshould go deeply into his consciousness—roused by a trumpet's\npeal, loud enough to awaken all of his energies that were not\ndead, but only slumbering—he was yet capable of flinging off\nhis infirmities like a sick man's gown, dropping the staff of\nage to seize a battle-sword, and starting up once more a\nwarrior.  And, in so intense a moment his demeanour would have\nstill been calm.  Such an exhibition, however, was but to be\npictured in fancy; not to be anticipated, nor desired.  What I\nsaw in him—as evidently as the indestructible ramparts of Old\nTiconderoga, already cited as the most appropriate simile—was\nthe features of stubborn and ponderous endurance, which might\nwell have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days; of\nintegrity, that, like most of his other endowments, lay in</p>",

He had slain men with his\nown hand, for aught I know—certainly, they had fallen like\nblades of grass at the sweep of the scythe before the charge to\nwhich his spirit imparted its triumphant energy—but, be that as\nit might, there was never in his heart so much cruelty as would\nhave brushed the down off a butterfly's wing.

A ray of humour,\nnow and then, would make its way through the veil of dim\nobstruction, and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces.  A trait of\nnative elegance, seldom seen in the masculine character after\nchildhood or early youth, was shown in the General's fondness\nfor the sight and fragrance of flowers.

If, in our country, valour were\nrewarded by heraldic honour, this phrase—which it seems so easy\nto speak, but which only he, with such a task of danger and\nglory before him, has ever spoken—would be the best and fittest\nof all mottoes for the General's shield of arms.</p>",

He was, indeed, the Custom-House in\nhimself; or, at all events, the mainspring that kept its\nvariously revolving wheels in motion; for, in an institution\nlike this, where its officers are appointed to subserve their\nown profit and convenience, and seldom with a leading reference\nto their fitness for the duty to be performed, they must\nperforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them.\nThus, by an inevitable necessity, as a magnet attracts\nsteel-filings, so did our man of business draw to himself the\ndifficulties which everybody met with.  With an easy\ncondescension, and kind forbearance towards our\nstupidity—which, to his order of mind, must have seemed little\nshort of crime—would he forth-with, by the merest touch of his\nfinger, make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight.  The\nmerchants valued him not less than we, his esoteric friends.  His\nintegrity was perfect; it was a law of nature with him,</p>",

Then, she was\nsupported by an unnatural tension of the nerves, and by all the\ncombative energy of her character, which enabled her to convert\nthe scene into a kind of lurid triumph.  It was, moreover, a\nseparate and insulated event, to occur but once in her lifetime,\nand to meet which, therefore, reckless of economy, she might\ncall up the vital strength that would have sufficed for many\nquiet years.

Throughout them all, giving up her\nindividuality, she would become the general symbol at which the\npreacher and moralist might point, and in which they might\nvivify and embody their images of woman's frailty and sinful\npassion.  Thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her,\nwith the scarlet letter flaming on her breast—at her, the child\nof honourable parents—at her, the mother of a babe that would\nhereafter be a woman—at her, who had once been innocent—as the\nfigure, the body, the reality of sin.

The mother's impassioned state had been the\nmedium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the\nrays of its moral life; and, however white and clear originally,\nthey had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold, the fiery\nlustre, the black shadow, and the</p>",

Her mother, while Pearl was yet\nan infant, grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look, that\nwarned her when it would be labour thrown away to insist,\npersuade or plead.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was a look so intelligent, yet inexplicable, perverse,\nsometimes so malicious, but generally accompanied by a</p>",
  "page-193": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">wild flow\nof spirits, that Hester could not help questioning at such\nmoments whether Pearl was a human child.  She seemed rather an\nairy sprite, which, after playing its fantastic sports for a\nlittle while upon the cottage floor, would flit away with a\nmocking smile.  Whenever that look appeared in her wild, bright,\ndeeply black eyes, it invested her with a strange remoteness and\nintangibility: it was as if she were hovering in the air, and\nmight vanish, like a glimmering light that comes we know not\nwhence and goes we know not whither.  Beholding it, Hester was\nconstrained to rush towards the child—to pursue the little elf\nin the flight which she invariably began—to snatch her to her\nbosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses—not so much from\noverflowing love as to assure herself that Pearl was flesh and\nblood, and not utterly delusive.  But Pearl's laugh, when she was\ncaught, though full of merriment and music, made her mother more\ndoubtful than before.</p>",
  "page-194": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Heart-smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell, that so\noften came between herself and her sole treasure, whom she had\nbought so dear, and who was all her world, Hester sometimes\nburst into passionate tears.  Then, perhaps—for there was no\nforeseeing how it might affect her—Pearl would frown, and\nclench her little fist, and harden her small features into a\nstern, unsympathising look of discontent.  Not seldom she would\nlaugh anew, and louder than before, like a thing incapable and\nunintelligent of human sorrow.  Or—but this more rarely\nhappened—she would be convulsed with rage of grief and sob out\nher love for her mother in broken words, and seem intent on\nproving that she had a heart by breaking it.  Yet Hester was\nhardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness: it\npassed as suddenly as it came.  Brooding over all these matters,\nthe mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit, but, by some\nirregularity in the process of conjuration, has</p>",

And then what a\nhappiness would it have been could Hester Prynne have heard her\nclear, bird-like voice mingling with the uproar of other\nchildish voices, and have distinguished and unravelled her own\ndarling's tones, amid all the entangled outcry of a group of\nsportive children.  But this could never be.  Pearl was a born\noutcast of the infantile world.  An imp of evil, emblem and\nproduct of sin, she had no right</p>",
  "page-196": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">among christened infants.\nNothing was more remarkable than the instinct, as it seemed,\nwith which the child comprehended her loneliness: the destiny\nthat had drawn an inviolable circle round about her: the whole\npeculiarity, in short, of her position in respect to other\nchildren.  Never since her release from prison had Hester met the\npublic gaze without her.  In all her walks about the town, Pearl,\ntoo, was there: first as the babe in arms, and afterwards as the\nlittle girl, small companion of her mother, holding a forefinger\nwith her whole grasp, and tripping along at the rate of three or\nfour footsteps to one of Hester's.  She saw the children of the\nsettlement on the grassy margin of the street, or at the\ndomestic thresholds, disporting themselves in such grim fashions\nas the Puritanic nurture would permit; playing at going to\nchurch, perchance, or at scourging Quakers; or taking scalps in\na sham fight with the Indians, or scaring one another with\nfreaks of imitative witchcraft. </p>",
  "page-197": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Pearl saw, and gazed intently,\nbut never sought to make acquaintance.  If spoken to, she would\nnot speak again.  If the children gathered about her, as they\nsometimes did, Pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny\nwrath, snatching up stones to fling at them, with shrill,\nincoherent exclamations, that made her mother tremble, because\nthey had so much the sound of a witch's anathemas in some\nunknown tongue.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The truth was, that the little Puritans, being of the most\nintolerant brood that ever lived, had got a vague idea of\nsomething outlandish, unearthly, or at variance with ordinary\nfashions, in the mother and child, and therefore scorned them in\ntheir hearts, and not unfrequently reviled them with their\ntongues.  Pearl felt the sentiment, and requited it with the\nbitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish\nbosom.  These outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value,\nand even comfort for the mother; because there was at</p>",
  "page-198": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">least an\nintelligible earnestness in the mood, instead of the fitful\ncaprice that so often thwarted her in the child's\nmanifestations.  It appalled her, nevertheless, to discern here,\nagain, a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in\nherself.  All this enmity and passion had Pearl inherited, by\ninalienable right, out of Hester's heart.  Mother and daughter\nstood together in the same circle of seclusion from human\nsociety; and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated\nthose unquiet elements that had distracted Hester Prynne before\nPearl's birth, but had since begun to be soothed away by the\nsoftening influences of maternity.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At home, within and around her mother's cottage, Pearl wanted\nnot a wide and various circle of acquaintance.

The unlikeliest materials—a stick,\na bunch of</p>",
  "page-199": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">rags, a flower—were the puppets of Pearl's\nwitchcraft, and, without undergoing any outward change, became\nspiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her\ninner world.  Her one baby-voice served a multitude of imaginary\npersonages, old and young, to talk withal.  The pine-trees, aged,\nblack, and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy\nutterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figure\nas Puritan elders; the ugliest weeds of the garden were their\nchildren, whom Pearl smote down and uprooted most unmercifully.\nIt was wonderful, the vast variety of forms into which she threw\nher intellect, with no continuity, indeed, but darting up and\ndancing, always in a state of preternatural activity—soon\nsinking down, as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of\nlife—and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy.

The\nsingularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child\nregarded all these offsprings of her own heart and mind.  She\nnever created a friend, but seemed always to be sowing broadcast\nthe dragon's teeth, whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies,\nagainst whom she rushed to battle.  It was inexpressibly\nsad—then what depth of sorrow to a mother, who felt in her own\nheart the cause—to observe, in one so young, this constant\nrecognition of an adverse world, and so fierce a training of the\nenergies that were to make good her cause in the contest that\nmust ensue.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Gazing at Pearl, Hester Prynne often dropped her work upon her\nknees, and cried out with an agony</p>",

The very first thing which she had noticed in her life,\nwas—what?—not the mother's smile, responding to it, as other\nbabies do, by that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth,\nremembered so doubtfully afterwards, and with such fond\ndiscussion whether it were indeed a smile.  By no means!  But that\nfirst object of which Pearl seemed to become aware was—shall we\nsay it?—the scarlet letter on Hester's bosom! </p>",
  "page-202": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">One day, as her\nmother stooped over the cradle, the infant's eyes had been\ncaught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the\nletter; and putting up her little hand she grasped at it,\nsmiling, not doubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her\nface the look of a much older child.  Then, gasping for breath,\ndid Hester Prynne clutch the fatal token, instinctively\nendeavouring to tear it away, so infinite was the torture\ninflicted by the intelligent touch of Pearl's baby-hand.  Again,\nas if her mother's agonised gesture were meant only to make\nsport for her, did little Pearl look into her eyes, and smile.\nFrom that epoch, except when the child was asleep, Hester had\nnever felt a moment's safety: not a moment's calm enjoyment of\nher.  Weeks, it is true, would sometimes elapse, during which\nPearl's gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter;\nbut then, again, it would come at unawares, like the stroke of\nsudden death, and always with that peculiar smile</p>",

It was a face,\nfiend-like, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblance of\nfeatures that she had known full well, though seldom with a\nsmile, and never with malice in them.  It was as if an evil\nspirit possessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in\nmockery.  Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured, though\nless vividly, by the same illusion.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the afternoon of a certain summer's day, after Pearl grew big\nenough to run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls\nof wild flowers, and flinging</p>",

Still came the battery of flowers, almost invariably\nhitting the mark, and covering the mother's breast with hurts\nfor which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew how to\nseek it in another.  At last, her shot being all expended, the\nchild stood still and gazed at Hester, with that little laughing\nimage of a fiend peeping out—or, whether it peeped or no, her\nmother so imagined it—from the unsearchable abyss of her black\neyes.</p><p>\"Child, what art thou?\" cried the mother.</p><p>\"Oh, I am your little Pearl!\" answered the child.</p>",

But that perversity, which all children have\nmore or less of, and of which little Pearl had a tenfold\nportion, now, at the most inopportune moment, took thorough\npossession of her, and closed her lips, or impelled her to speak\nwords amiss.  After putting her finger in her mouth, with many\nungracious refusals to answer good Mr. Wilson's question, the\nchild finally announced that she had not been made at all, but\nhad been plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that\ngrew by the prison-door.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This phantasy was probably suggested by the near</p>",

  "page-253": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">questions were solemnly propounded to Mr. Dimmesdale by\nthe elder ministers of Boston, and the deacons of his church,\nwho, to use their own phrase, \"dealt with him,\" on the sin of\nrejecting the aid which Providence so manifestly held out.  He\nlistened in silence, and finally promised to confer with the\nphysician.</p><p>\"Were it God's will,\" said the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, when, in\nfulfilment of this pledge, he requested old Roger\nChillingworth's professional advice, \"I could be well content\nthat my labours, and my sorrows, and my sins, and my pains,\nshould shortly end with me, and what is earthly of them be\nburied in my grave, and the spiritual go with me to my eternal\nstate, rather than that you should put your skill to the proof\nin my behalf.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Ah,\" replied Roger Chillingworth, with that quietness, which,\nwhether imposed or natural, marked</p>",

  "page-255": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">spend much time\ntogether.  For the sake of the minister's health, and to enable\nthe leech to gather plants with healing balm in them, they took\nlong walks on the sea-shore, or in the forest; mingling various\nwalks with the splash and murmur of the waves, and the solemn\nwind-anthem among the tree-tops.  Often, likewise, one was the\nguest of the other in his place of study and retirement.  There\nwas a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of\nscience, in whom he recognised an intellectual cultivation of no\nmoderate depth or scope; together with a range and freedom of\nideas, that he would have vainly looked for among the members of\nhis own profession.  In truth, he was startled, if not shocked,\nto find this attribute in the physician.  Mr. Dimmesdale was a\ntrue priest, a true religionist, with the reverential sentiment\nlargely developed, and an order of mind that impelled itself\npowerfully along the track of a creed, and wore its</p>",
  "page-256": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">passage\ncontinually deeper with the lapse of time.  In no state of\nsociety would he have been what is called a man of liberal\nviews; it would always be essential to his peace to feel the\npressure of a faith about him, supporting, while it confined him\nwithin its iron framework.  Not the less, however, though with a\ntremulous enjoyment, did he feel the occasional relief of\nlooking at the universe through the medium of another kind of\nintellect than those with which he habitually held converse.  It\nwas as if a window were thrown open, admitting a freer\natmosphere into the close and stifled study, where his life was\nwasting itself away, amid lamp-light, or obstructed day-beams,\nand the musty fragrance, be it sensual or moral, that exhales\nfrom books.  But the air was too fresh and chill to be long\nbreathed with comfort.  So the minister, and the physician with\nhim, withdrew again within the limits of what their Church\ndefined as orthodox.</p>",
  "page-257": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Thus Roger Chillingworth scrutinised his patient carefully, both\nas he saw him in his ordinary life, keeping an accustomed\npathway in the range of thoughts familiar to him, and as he\nappeared when thrown amidst other moral scenery, the novelty of\nwhich might call out something new to the surface of his\ncharacter.  He deemed it essential, it would seem, to know the\nman, before attempting to do him good.  Wherever there is a heart\nand an intellect, the diseases of the physical frame are tinged\nwith the peculiarities of these.  In Arthur Dimmesdale, thought\nand imagination were so active, and sensibility so intense, that\nthe bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork\nthere.  So Roger Chillingworth—the man of skill, the kind and\nfriendly physician—strove to go deep into his patient's bosom,\ndelving among his principles, prying into his recollections, and\nprobing everything with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker\nin a dark cavern.  Few secrets</p>",

The latter had his suspicions, indeed,\nthat even the nature of Mr. Dimmesdale's bodily disease had\nnever fairly been revealed to him.  It was a strange reserve!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After a time, at a hint from Roger Chillingworth, the friends of\nMr. Dimmesdale effected an arrangement</p>",
  "page-260": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">by which the two were\nlodged in the same house; so that every ebb and flow of the\nminister's life-tide might pass under the eye of his anxious and\nattached physician.  There was much joy throughout the town when\nthis greatly desirable object was attained.  It was held to be\nthe best possible measure for the young clergyman's welfare;\nunless, indeed, as often urged by such as felt authorised to do\nso, he had selected some one of the many blooming damsels,\nspiritually devoted to him, to become his devoted wife.  This\nlatter step, however, there was no present prospect that Arthur\nDimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take; he rejected all\nsuggestions of the kind, as if priestly celibacy were one of his\narticles of Church discipline.  Doomed by his own choice,\ntherefore, as Mr. Dimmesdale so evidently was, to eat his\nunsavoury morsel always at another's board, and endure the\nlife-long chill which must be his lot who seeks to warm himself\nonly at another's fireside, it truly</p>",
  "page-261": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">seemed that this sagacious,\nexperienced, benevolent old physician, with his concord of\npaternal and reverential love for the young pastor, was the very\nman, of all mankind, to be constantly within reach of his voice.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow, of good\nsocial rank, who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the\nsite on which the venerable structure of King's Chapel has since\nbeen built.

The motherly care of the good\nwidow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front apartment, with a sunny\nexposure, and heavy window-curtains, to create a noontide shadow\nwhen desirable.  The walls were hung round with tapestry, said to\nbe from the Gobelin looms, and, at all events, representing the\nScriptural story of David and Bathsheba, and</p>",

On the other side of the\nhouse, old Roger Chillingworth arranged his study and\nlaboratory: not such as a modern man of science would reckon\neven tolerably complete, but provided with a distilling\napparatus and the means of compounding drugs and chemicals,\nwhich the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to purpose.\nWith such commodiousness of situation, these two learned persons\nsat themselves down, each in his own domain, yet familiarly\npassing from one apartment to the other, and bestowing a mutual\nand not incurious</p>",

When an uninstructed multitude attempts to see with\nits eyes, it is exceedingly apt to be deceived.  When, however,\nit forms its judgment, as it usually does, on the intuitions of\nits great and warm heart, the conclusions thus attained are\noften so profound and so unerring as to possess the character of\ntruth supernaturally revealed.

Two or three individuals hinted that the man\nof skill, during his Indian captivity, had enlarged his medical\nattainments by joining in the incantations of the savage\npriests, who were universally acknowledged to be powerful\nenchanters, often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their\nskill in the black art.

  "page-265": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">remarkable\nchange while he had dwelt in town, and especially since his\nabode with Mr. Dimmesdale.  At first, his expression had been\ncalm, meditative, scholar-like.

He groped along as stealthily, with as cautious a tread,\nand as wary an outlook, as a thief entering a chamber where a\nman lies only half asleep—or, it may be, broad awake—with\npurpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the\napple of his eye.

The young clergyman, after a few hours of privacy,\nwas sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried him\ninto an unseemly outbreak of temper, which there had been\nnothing in the physician's words to excuse or palliate.  He\nmarvelled, indeed, at the violence with which he had thrust back\nthe kind old man, when merely proffering the advice which it was\nhis duty to bestow, and which the minister himself had expressly\nsought.  With these remorseful feelings, he lost no time in\nmaking the amplest apologies, and besought his friend still to\ncontinue the care which, if not successful in restoring him to\nhealth, had, in all probability, been the means of prolonging\nhis feeble existence to that hour.

By\nits aid, in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and Mr.\nDimmesdale, not merely the external presence, but the very\ninmost soul of the latter, seemed to be brought out before his\neyes, so that he could see and comprehend its every movement.  He\nbecame, thenceforth, not a spectator only, but a chief actor in\nthe poor minister's interior world.  He could play upon him as he\nchose.  Would he arouse him with a throb of agony?  The victim was\nfor ever on the rack; it needed only to know the spring that\ncontrolled the engine: and the physician knew it well.  Would he\nstartle him with sudden fear?  As at the waving of a magician's\nwand, up rose a grisly phantom—up rose a thousand phantoms—in\nmany shapes, of death, or more awful shame, all flocking round\nabout the clergyman, and pointing with their fingers at his\nbreast!</p>",
  "page-292": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">All this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect, that the\nminister, though he had constantly a dim perception of some evil\ninfluence watching over him, could never gain a knowledge of its\nactual nature.

His gestures, his gait, his\ngrizzled beard, his slightest and most indifferent acts, the\nvery fashion of his garments, were odious in the clergyman's\nsight; a token implicitly to be relied on of a deeper antipathy\nin the breast of the latter than he was willing to acknowledge\nto himself.

He kept vigils,\nlikewise, night after night, sometimes in utter darkness,\nsometimes with a glimmering lamp, and sometimes, viewing his own\nface in a looking-glass, by the most powerful light which he\ncould throw upon it.  He thus typified the constant introspection\nwherewith</p>",
  "page-302": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">he tortured, but could not purify himself.

Now it\nwas a herd of diabolic shapes, that grinned and mocked at the\npale minister, and beckoned him away with them; now a group of\nshining angels, who flew upward heavily, as sorrow-laden, but\ngrew more ethereal as they rose.

But, for all that, they were, in one sense, the truest\nand most substantial things which the poor minister now dealt\nwith.  It is the unspeakable misery of a life so false as his,\nthat it steals the pith and substance out of whatever realities\nthere are around us, and which were meant by Heaven to be the\nspirit's joy and nutriment.

On that spot, in very truth,\nthere was, and there had long been, the gnawing and poisonous\ntooth of bodily pain.  Without any effort of his will, or power\nto restrain himself, he shrieked aloud: an outcry that went\npealing through the night, and was beaten back from one house to\nanother, and reverberated from the hills in the background; as\nif a company of devils, detecting so much misery and terror in\nit, had made a plaything of the sound, and were bandying it to\nand fro.</p><p>\"It is done!\" muttered the minister, covering his face with his\nhands.  \"The whole town will awake and hurry forth, and find me\nhere!\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But it was not so.

As the light drew nearer, he beheld,\nwithin its illuminated circle, his brother clergyman—or, to\nspeak more accurately, his professional father, as well as\nhighly valued friend—the Reverend Mr. Wilson, who, as Mr.\nDimmesdale now conjectured, had been praying at the bedside of\nsome dying man.

It was immediately responded to by a\nlight, airy, childish laugh, in which, with a thrill of the\nheart—but he knew not whether of exquisite pain, or pleasure as\nacute—he recognised the tones of little Pearl.</p><p>\"Pearl!

  "page-317": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">\"What sent you\nhither?\"</p><p>\"I have been watching at a death-bed,\" answered Hester Prynne\n\"at Governor Winthrop's death-bed, and have taken his measure\nfor a robe, and am now going homeward to my dwelling.\"</p><p>\"Come up hither, Hester, thou and little Pearl,\" said the\nReverend Mr. Dimmesdale.  \"Ye have both been here before, but I\nwas not with you.

His nerve seemed absolutely destroyed.  His\nmoral force was abased into more than childish weakness.  It\ngrovelled helpless on the ground, even while his intellectual\nfaculties retained their pristine strength, or had perhaps\nacquired a morbid energy, which disease only could have given\nthem.  With her knowledge of a train of circumstances hidden from\nall others, she could readily</p>",
  "page-331": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">infer that, besides the legitimate\naction of his own conscience, a terrible machinery had been\nbrought to bear, and was still operating, on Mr. Dimmesdale's\nwell-being and repose.  Knowing what this poor fallen man had\nonce been, her whole soul was moved by the shuddering terror\nwith which he had appealed to her—the outcast woman—for\nsupport against his instinctively discovered enemy.  She decided,\nmoreover, that he had a right to her utmost aid.  Little\naccustomed, in her long seclusion from society, to measure her\nideas of right and wrong by any standard external to herself,\nHester saw—or seemed to see—that there lay a responsibility\nupon her in reference to the clergyman, which she owned to no\nother, nor to the whole world besides.  The links that united her\nto the rest of humankind—links of flowers, or silk, or gold, or\nwhatever the material—had all been broken.  Here was the iron\nlink of mutual crime, which neither he nor she</p>",
  "page-332": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">could break.  Like\nall other ties, it brought along with it its obligations.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Hester Prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position in\nwhich we beheld her during the earlier periods of her ignominy.\nYears had come and gone.  Pearl was now seven years old.  Her\nmother, with the scarlet letter on her breast, glittering in its\nfantastic embroidery, had long been a familiar object to the\ntownspeople.  As is apt to be the case when a person stands out\nin any prominence before the community, and, at the same time,\ninterferes neither with public nor individual interests and\nconvenience, a species of general regard had ultimately grown up\nin reference to Hester Prynne.  It is to the credit of human\nnature that, except where its selfishness is brought into play,\nit loves more readily than it hates.  Hatred, by a gradual and\nquiet process, will even be transformed to love, unless the\nchange be impeded by a continually new irritation</p>",
  "page-333": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of the\noriginal feeling of hostility.  In this matter of Hester Prynne\nthere was neither irritation nor irksomeness.  She never battled\nwith the public, but submitted uncomplainingly to its worst\nusage; she made no claim upon it in requital for what she\nsuffered; she did not weigh upon its sympathies.  Then, also, the\nblameless purity of her life during all these years in which she\nhad been set apart to infamy was reckoned largely in her favour.\nWith nothing now to lose, in the sight of mankind, and with no\nhope, and seemingly no wish, of gaining anything, it could only\nbe a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back the poor\nwanderer to its paths.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was perceived, too, that while Hester never put forward even\nthe humblest title to share in the world's privileges—further\nthan to breathe the common air and earn daily bread for little\nPearl and herself by the faithful labour of her hands—she was\nquick to</p>",
  "page-334": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man\nwhenever benefits were to be conferred.  None so ready as she to\ngive of her little substance to every demand of poverty, even\nthough the bitter-hearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital\nof the food brought regularly to his door, or the garments\nwrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a\nmonarch's robe.  None so self-devoted as Hester when pestilence\nstalked through the town.  In all seasons of calamity, indeed,\nwhether general or of individuals, the outcast of society at\nonce found her place.  She came, not as a guest, but as a\nrightful inmate, into the household that was darkened by\ntrouble, as if its gloomy twilight were a medium in which she\nwas entitled to hold intercourse with her fellow-creature.  There\nglimmered the embroidered letter, with comfort in its unearthly\nray.  Elsewhere the token of sin, it was the taper of the sick\nchamber.  It had even thrown its gleam, in the sufferer's hard\nextremity,</p>",
  "page-335": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">across the verge of time.  It had shown him where to\nset his foot, while the light of earth was fast becoming dim,\nand ere the light of futurity could reach him.  In such\nemergencies Hester's nature showed itself warm and rich—a\nwell-spring of human tenderness, unfailing to every real demand,\nand inexhaustible by the largest.  Her breast, with its badge of\nshame, was but the softer pillow for the head that needed one.\nShe was self-ordained a Sister of Mercy, or, we may rather say,\nthe world's heavy hand had so ordained her, when neither the\nworld nor she looked forward to this result.  The letter was the\nsymbol of her calling.  Such helpfulness was found in her—so\nmuch power to do, and power to sympathise—that many people\nrefused to interpret the scarlet A by its original\nsignification.  They said that it meant Able, so strong was\nHester Prynne, with a woman's strength.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was only the darkened house that could contain</p>",
  "page-336": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">her.  When\nsunshine came again, she was not there.  Her shadow had faded\nacross the threshold.  The helpful inmate had departed, without\none backward glance to gather up the meed of gratitude, if any\nwere in the hearts of those whom she had served so zealously.\nMeeting them in the street, she never raised her head to receive\ntheir greeting.  If they were resolute to accost her, she laid\nher finger on the scarlet letter, and passed on.  This might be\npride, but was so like humility, that it produced all the\nsoftening influence of the latter quality on the public mind.\nThe public is despotic in its temper; it is capable of denying\ncommon justice when too strenuously demanded as a right; but\nquite as frequently it awards more than justice, when the appeal\nis made, as despots love to have it made, entirely to its\ngenerosity.  Interpreting Hester Prynne's deportment as an appeal\nof this nature, society was inclined to show its former victim a\nmore benign countenance than she</p>",
  "page-337": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">cared to be favoured with, or,\nperchance, than she deserved.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The rulers, and the wise and learned men of the community, were\nlonger in acknowledging the influence of Hester's good qualities\nthan the people.  The prejudices which they shared in common with\nthe latter were fortified in themselves by an iron frame-work of\nreasoning, that made it a far tougher labour to expel them.  Day\nby day, nevertheless, their sour and rigid wrinkles were\nrelaxing into something which, in the due course of years, might\ngrow to be an expression of almost benevolence.  Thus it was with\nthe men of rank, on whom their eminent position imposed the\nguardianship of the public morals.  Individuals in private life,\nmeanwhile, had quite forgiven Hester Prynne for her frailty;\nnay, more, they had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as the\ntoken, not of that one sin for which she had borne so long and\ndreary a</p>",
  "page-338": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">penance, but of her many good deeds since.  \"Do you see\nthat woman with the embroidered badge?\" they would say to\nstrangers.  \"It is our Hester—the town's own Hester—who is so\nkind to the poor, so helpful to the sick, so comfortable to the\nafflicted!\"  Then, it is true, the propensity of human nature to\ntell the very worst of itself, when embodied in the person of\nanother, would constrain them to whisper the black scandal of\nbygone years.  It was none the less a fact, however, that in the\neyes of the very men who spoke thus, the scarlet letter had the\neffect of the cross on a nun's bosom.  It imparted to the wearer\na kind of sacredness, which enabled her to walk securely amid\nall peril.  Had she fallen among thieves, it would have kept her\nsafe.  It was reported, and believed by many, that an Indian had\ndrawn his arrow against the badge, and that the missile struck\nit, and fell harmless to the ground.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The effect of the symbol—or rather, of the position</p>",
  "page-339": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">in respect\nto society that was indicated by it—on the mind of Hester\nPrynne herself was powerful and peculiar.  All the light and\ngraceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this\nred-hot brand, and had long ago fallen away, leaving a bare and\nharsh outline, which might have been repulsive had she possessed\nfriends or companions to be repelled by it.  Even the\nattractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change.  It\nmight be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress, and\npartly to the lack of demonstration in her manners.  It was a sad\ntransformation, too, that her rich and luxuriant hair had either\nbeen cut off, or was so completely hidden by a cap, that not a\nshining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine.  It was\ndue in part to all these causes, but still more to something\nelse, that there seemed to be no longer anything in Hester's\nface for Love to dwell upon; nothing in Hester's form, though\nmajestic and statue</p>",
  "page-340": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">like, that Passion would ever dream of\nclasping in its embrace; nothing in Hester's bosom to make it\never again the pillow of Affection.  Some attribute had departed\nfrom her, the permanence of which had been essential to keep her\na woman.  Such is frequently the fate, and such the stern\ndevelopment, of the feminine character and person, when the\nwoman has encountered, and lived through, an experience of\npeculiar severity.  If she be all tenderness, she will die.  If\nshe survive, the tenderness will either be crushed out of her,\nor—and the outward semblance is the same—crushed so deeply\ninto her heart that it can never show itself more.  The latter is\nperhaps the truest theory.  She who has once been a woman, and\nceased to be so, might at any moment become a woman again, if\nthere were only the magic touch to effect the transformation.  We\nshall see whether Hester Prynne were ever afterwards so touched\nand so transfigured.</p>",
  "page-341": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Much of the marble coldness of Hester's impression was to be\nattributed to the circumstance that her life had turned, in a\ngreat measure, from passion and feeling to thought.  Standing\nalone in the world—alone, as to any dependence on society, and\nwith little Pearl to be guided and protected—alone, and\nhopeless of retrieving her position, even had she not scorned to\nconsider it desirable—she cast away the fragment of a broken\nchain.  The world's law was no law for her mind.  It was an age in\nwhich the human intellect, newly emancipated, had taken a more\nactive and a wider range than for many centuries before.  Men of\nthe sword had overthrown nobles and kings.  Men bolder than these\nhad overthrown and rearranged—not actually, but within the\nsphere of theory, which was their most real abode—the whole\nsystem of ancient prejudice, wherewith was linked much of\nancient principle.  Hester Prynne imbibed this spirit.  She\nassumed a</p>",
  "page-342": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">freedom of speculation, then common enough on the\nother side of the Atlantic, but which our forefathers, had they\nknown it, would have held to be a deadlier crime than that\nstigmatised by the scarlet letter.

For some unaccountable reason, as Arthur Dimmesdale\nfelt the child's eyes upon himself, his hand—with that gesture\nso habitual as to have become involuntary—stole over his heart.\nAt length, assuming a singular air of authority, Pearl stretched\nout her hand, with the small forefinger extended, and pointing\nevidently towards her</p>",
  "page-435": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">mother's breast.  And beneath, in the\nmirror of the brook, there was the flower-girdled and sunny\nimage of little Pearl, pointing her small forefinger too.</p><p>\"Thou strange child!  why dost thou not come to me?\" exclaimed\nHester.</p><p>Pearl still pointed with her forefinger, and a frown gathered on\nher brow—the more impressive from the childish, the almost\nbaby-like aspect of the features that conveyed it.  As her mother\nstill kept beckoning to her, and arraying her face in a holiday\nsuit of unaccustomed smiles, the child stamped her foot with a\nyet more imperious look and gesture.  In the brook, again, was\nthe fantastic beauty of the image, with its reflected frown, its\npointed finger, and imperious gesture, giving emphasis to the\naspect of little Pearl.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Hasten, Pearl, or I shall be angry with thee!\" cried Hester\nPrynne, who, however, inured to such behaviour on the\nelf-child's part at other seasons, was naturally</p>",
  "page-436": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">anxious for a\nmore seemly deportment now.  \"Leap across the brook, naughty\nchild, and run hither!

She accompanied\nthis wild outbreak with piercing shrieks, which the woods\nreverberated on all sides, so that, alone as she was in her\nchildish and unreasonable wrath, it seemed as if a hidden\nmultitude were lending her their sympathy and encouragement.\nSeen in the brook once more was the shadowy wrath of Pearl's\nimage, crowned and girdled with flowers, but stamping its foot,\nwildly gesticulating, and, in the midst of all, still pointing\nits small forefinger at Hester's bosom.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I see what ails the child,\" whispered Hester to the</p>",
  "page-437": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">clergyman,\nand turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her\ntrouble and annoyance, \"Children will not abide any, the\nslightest, change in the accustomed aspect of things that are\ndaily before their eyes.  Pearl misses something that she has\nalways seen me wear!\"</p><p>\"I pray you,\" answered the minister, \"if thou hast any means of\npacifying the child, do it forthwith!

In Pearl's young beauty,\nas in the wrinkled witch, it has a preternatural effect.  Pacify\nher if thou lovest me!\"</p><p>Hester turned again towards Pearl with a crimson blush upon her\ncheek, a conscious glance aside clergyman, and then a heavy\nsigh, while, even before she had time to speak, the blush\nyielded to a deadly pallor.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Pearl,\" said she sadly, \"look down at thy feet! </p>",
  "page-438": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">There!—before\nthee!—on the hither side of the brook!\"</p><p>The child turned her eyes to the point indicated, and there lay\nthe scarlet letter so close upon the margin of the stream that\nthe gold embroidery was reflected in it.</p><p>\"Bring it hither!\" said Hester.</p><p>\"Come thou and take it up!\" answered Pearl.</p><p>\"Was ever such a child!\" observed Hester aside to the minister.\n\"Oh, I have much to tell thee about her!  But, in very truth, she\nis right as regards this hateful token.  I must bear its torture\nyet a little longer—only a few days longer—until we shall have\nleft this region, and look back hither as to a land which we\nhave dreamed of.  The forest cannot hide it!  The mid-ocean shall\ntake it from my hand, and swallow it up for ever!\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">With these words she advanced to the margin of the brook, took\nup the scarlet letter, and fastened it again into her bosom.\nHopefully, but a moment ago, as Hester had spoken of drowning it\nin the deep sea, there</p>",
  "page-439": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was a sense of inevitable doom upon her\nas she thus received back this deadly symbol from the hand of\nfate.  She had flung it into infinite space! she had drawn an\nhour's free breath! and here again was the scarlet misery\nglittering on the old spot!  So it ever is, whether thus typified\nor no, that an evil deed invests itself with the character of\ndoom.  Hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair and\nconfined them beneath her cap.  As if there were a withering\nspell in the sad letter, her beauty, the warmth and richness of\nher womanhood, departed like fading sunshine, and a gray shadow\nseemed to fall across her.</p><p>When the dreary change was wrought, she extended her hand to\nPearl.</p><p>\"Dost thou know thy mother now, child?\", asked she,\nreproachfully, but with a subdued tone.  \"Wilt thou come across\nthe brook, and own thy mother, now that she has her shame upon\nher—now that she is sad?\"</p>",
  "page-440": "<p>\"Yes; now I will!\" answered the child, bounding across the\nbrook, and clasping Hester in her arms \"Now thou art my mother\nindeed! and I am thy little Pearl!\"</p><p>In a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her, she drew\ndown her mother's head, and kissed her brow and both her cheeks.\nBut then—by a kind of necessity that always impelled this child\nto alloy whatever comfort she might chance to give with a throb\nof anguish—Pearl put up her mouth and kissed the scarlet\nletter, too.</p><p>\"That was not kind!\" said Hester.  \"When thou hast shown me a\nlittle love, thou mockest me!\"</p><p>\"Why doth the minister sit yonder?\" asked Pearl.</p><p>\"He waits to welcome thee,\" replied her mother.  \"Come thou, and\nentreat his blessing!  He loves thee, my little Pearl, and loves\nthy mother, too.  Wilt thou not love him?

Thou wilt love him—wilt\nthou not?\"</p><p>\"And will he always keep his hand over his heart?\" inquired\nPearl.</p><p>\"Foolish child, what a question is that!\" exclaimed her mother.\n\"Come, and ask his blessing!\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But, whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive\nwith every petted child towards a dangerous rival, or from\nwhatever caprice of her freakish nature, Pearl would show no\nfavour to the clergyman.

  "page-442": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">reluctance by odd grimaces; of which, ever since\nher babyhood, she had possessed a singular variety, and could\ntransform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different\naspects, with a new mischief in them, each and all.  The\nminister—painfully embarrassed, but hoping that a kiss might\nprove a talisman to admit him into the child's kindlier\nregards—bent forward, and impressed one on her brow.  Hereupon,\nPearl broke away from her mother, and, running to the brook,\nstooped over it, and bathed her forehead, until the unwelcome\nkiss was quite washed off and diffused through a long lapse of\nthe gliding water.  She then remained apart, silently watching\nHester and the clergyman; while they talked together and made\nsuch arrangements as were suggested by their new position and\nthe purposes soon to be fulfilled.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And now this fateful interview had come to a close.

So great a vicissitude in his life could not at once be\nreceived as real.  But there was Hester, clad in her gray robe,\nstill standing beside the tree-trunk, which some blast had\noverthrown a long antiquity ago, and which time had ever since\nbeen covering with moss, so that</p>",
  "page-445": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">these two fated ones, with\nearth's heaviest burden on them, might there sit down together,\nand find a single hour's rest and solace.  And there was Pearl,\ntoo, lightly dancing from the margin of the brook—now that the\nintrusive third person was gone—and taking her old place by her\nmother's side.  So the minister had not fallen asleep and\ndreamed!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity\nof impression, which vexed it with a strange disquietude, he\nrecalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which Hester and\nhimself had sketched for their departure.  It had been determined\nbetween them that the Old World, with its crowds and cities,\noffered them a more eligible shelter and concealment than the\nwilds of New England or all America, with its alternatives of an\nIndian wigwam, or the few settlements of Europeans scattered\nthinly along the sea-board.  Not to speak of the clergyman's\nhealth,</p>",
  "page-446": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">so inadequate to sustain the hardships of a forest life,\nhis native gifts, his culture, and his entire development would\nsecure him a home only in the midst of civilization and\nrefinement; the higher the state the more delicately adapted to\nit the man.  In furtherance of this choice, it so happened that a\nship lay in the harbour; one of those unquestionable cruisers,\nfrequent at that day, which, without being absolutely outlaws of\nthe deep, yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable\nirresponsibility of character.  This vessel had recently arrived\nfrom the Spanish Main, and within three days' time would sail\nfor Bristol.  Hester Prynne—whose vocation, as a self-enlisted\nSister of Charity, had brought her acquainted with the captain\nand crew—could take upon herself to secure the passage of two\nindividuals and a child with all the secrecy which circumstances\nrendered more than desirable.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The minister had inquired of Hester, with no little</p>",
  "page-447": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">interest,\nthe precise time at which the vessel might be expected to\ndepart.  It would probably be on the fourth day from the present.\n\"This is most fortunate!\" he had then said to himself.  Now, why\nthe Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale considered it so very fortunate we\nhesitate to reveal.  Nevertheless—to hold nothing back from the\nreader—it was because, on the third day from the present, he\nwas to preach the Election Sermon; and, as such an occasion\nformed an honourable epoch in the life of a New England\nClergyman, he could not have chanced upon a more suitable mode\nand time of terminating his professional career.  \"At least, they\nshall say of me,\" thought this exemplary man, \"that I leave no\npublic duty unperformed or ill-performed!\"  Sad, indeed, that an\nintrospection so profound and acute as this poor minister's\nshould be so miserably deceived!  We have had, and may still\nhave, worse things to tell of him; but none, we apprehend, so\npitiably weak; no evidence,</p>",
  "page-448": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">at once so slight and irrefragable,\nof a subtle disease that had long since begun to eat into the\nreal substance of his character.  No man, for any considerable\nperiod, can wear one face to himself and another to the\nmultitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be\nthe true.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The excitement of Mr. Dimmesdale's feelings as he returned from\nhis interview with Hester, lent him unaccustomed physical\nenergy, and hurried him townward at a rapid pace.  The pathway\namong the woods seemed wilder, more uncouth with its rude\nnatural obstacles, and less trodden by the foot of man, than he\nremembered it on his outward journey.  But he leaped across the\nplashy places, thrust himself through the clinging underbrush,\nclimbed the ascent, plunged into the hollow, and overcame, in\nshort, all the difficulties of the track, with an unweariable\nactivity that astonished him.  He could not but recall</p>",
  "page-449": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">how\nfeebly, and with what frequent pauses for breath he had toiled\nover the same ground, only two days before.  As he drew near the\ntown, he took an impression of change from the series of\nfamiliar objects that presented themselves.  It seemed not\nyesterday, not one, not two, but many days, or even years ago,\nsince he had quitted them.  There, indeed, was each former trace\nof the street, as he remembered it, and all the peculiarities of\nthe houses, with the due multitude of gable-peaks, and a\nweather-cock at every point where his memory suggested one.  Not\nthe less, however, came this importunately obtrusive sense of\nchange.  The same was true as regarded the acquaintances whom he\nmet, and all the well-known shapes of human life, about the\nlittle town.  They looked neither older nor younger now; the\nbeards of the aged were no whiter, nor could the creeping babe\nof yesterday walk on his feet to-day; it was impossible to\ndescribe in what respect they differed</p>",
  "page-450": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">from the individuals on\nwhom he had so recently bestowed a parting glance; and yet the\nminister's deepest sense seemed to inform him of their\nmutability.  A similar impression struck him most remarkably as\nhe passed under the walls of his own church.  The edifice had so\nvery strange, and yet so familiar an aspect, that Mr.\nDimmesdale's mind vibrated between two ideas; either that he had\nseen it only in a dream hitherto, or that he was merely dreaming\nabout it now.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This phenomenon, in the various shapes which it assumed,\nindicated no external change, but so sudden and important a\nchange in the spectator of the familiar scene, that the\nintervening space of a single day had operated on his\nconsciousness like the lapse of years.  The minister's own will,\nand Hester's will, and the fate that grew between them, had\nwrought this transformation.  It was the same town as heretofore,\nbut the same minister returned not from the forest.  He</p>",
  "page-451": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">might\nhave said to the friends who greeted him—\"I am not the man for\nwhom you take me!  I left him yonder in the forest, withdrawn\ninto a secret dell, by a mossy tree trunk, and near a melancholy\nbrook!  Go, seek your minister, and see if his emaciated figure,\nhis thin cheek, his white, heavy, pain-wrinkled brow, be not\nflung down there, like a cast-off garment!\"  His friends, no\ndoubt, would still have insisted with him—\"Thou art thyself the\nman!\" but the error would have been their own, not his.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Before Mr. Dimmesdale reached home, his inner man gave him other\nevidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling.\nIn truth, nothing short of a total change of dynasty and moral\ncode, in that interior kingdom, was adequate to account for the\nimpulses now communicated to the unfortunate and startled\nminister.  At every step he was incited to do some strange, wild,\nwicked thing or other, with a sense</p>",
  "page-452": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">that it would be at once\ninvoluntary and intentional, in spite of himself, yet growing\nout of a profounder self than that which opposed the impulse.\nFor instance, he met one of his own deacons.  The good old man\naddressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal\nprivilege which his venerable age, his upright and holy\ncharacter, and his station in the church, entitled him to use\nand, conjoined with this, the deep, almost worshipping respect,\nwhich the minister's professional and private claims alike\ndemanded.  Never was there a more beautiful example of how the\nmajesty of age and wisdom may comport with the obeisance and\nrespect enjoined upon it, as from a lower social rank, and\ninferior order of endowment, towards a higher.  Now, during a\nconversation of some two or three moments between the Reverend\nMr. Dimmesdale and this excellent and hoary-bearded deacon, it\nwas only by the most careful self-control that the former</p>",
  "page-453": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">could\nrefrain from uttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose\ninto his mind, respecting the communion-supper.  He absolutely\ntrembled and turned pale as ashes, lest his tongue should wag\nitself in utterance of these horrible matters, and plead his own\nconsent for so doing, without his having fairly given it.  And,\neven with this terror in his heart, he could hardly avoid\nlaughing, to imagine how the sanctified old patriarchal deacon\nwould have been petrified by his minister's impiety.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Again, another incident of the same nature.  Hurrying along the\nstreet, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale encountered the eldest\nfemale member of his church, a most pious and exemplary old\ndame, poor, widowed, lonely, and with a heart as full of\nreminiscences about her dead husband and children, and her dead\nfriends of long ago, as a burial-ground is full of storied\ngravestones.  Yet all this, which would else</p>",
  "page-454": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">have been such heavy\nsorrow, was made almost a solemn joy to her devout old soul, by\nreligious consolations and the truths of Scripture, wherewith\nshe had fed herself continually for more than thirty years.  And\nsince Mr. Dimmesdale had taken her in charge, the good grandam's\nchief earthly comfort—which, unless it had been likewise a\nheavenly comfort, could have been none at all—was to meet her\npastor, whether casually, or of set purpose, and be refreshed\nwith a word of warm, fragrant, heaven-breathing Gospel truth,\nfrom his beloved lips, into her dulled, but rapturously\nattentive ear.  But, on this occasion, up to the moment of\nputting his lips to the old woman's ear, Mr. Dimmesdale, as the\ngreat enemy of souls would have it, could recall no text of\nScripture, nor aught else, except a brief, pithy, and, as it\nthen appeared to him, unanswerable argument against the\nimmortality of the human soul.  The instilment thereof into her\nmind would probably have</p>",
  "page-455": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">caused this aged sister to drop down\ndead, at once, as by the effect of an intensely poisonous\ninfusion.  What he really did whisper, the minister could never\nafterwards recollect.  There was, perhaps, a fortunate disorder\nin his utterance, which failed to impart any distinct idea to\nthe good widows comprehension, or which Providence interpreted\nafter a method of its own.  Assuredly, as the minister looked\nback, he beheld an expression of divine gratitude and ecstasy\nthat seemed like the shine of the celestial city on her face, so\nwrinkled and ashy pale.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Again, a third instance.  After parting from the old church\nmember, he met the youngest sister of them all.  It was a maiden\nnewly-won—and won by the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale's own sermon,\non the Sabbath after his vigil—to barter the transitory\npleasures of the world for the heavenly hope that was to assume\nbrighter substance as life grew dark around her, and which would\ngild the utter gloom with final glory.  She was fair</p>",
  "page-456": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">and pure as\na lily that had bloomed in Paradise.  The minister knew well that\nhe was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity of her\nheart, which hung its snowy curtains about his image, imparting\nto religion the warmth of love, and to love a religious purity.\nSatan, that afternoon, had surely led the poor young girl away\nfrom her mother's side, and thrown her into the pathway of this\nsorely tempted, or—shall we not rather say?—this lost and\ndesperate man.  As she drew nigh, the arch-fiend whispered him to\ncondense into small compass, and drop into her tender bosom a\ngerm of evil that would be sure to blossom darkly soon, and bear\nblack fruit betimes.  Such was his sense of power over this\nvirgin soul, trusting him as she did, that the minister felt\npotent to blight all the field of innocence with but one wicked\nlook, and develop all its opposite with but a word.  So—with a\nmightier struggle than he had yet sustained—he held his Geneva\ncloak before his</p>",
  "page-457": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">face, and hurried onward, making no sign of\nrecognition, and leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness\nas she might.  She ransacked her conscience—which was full of\nharmless little matters, like her pocket or her work-bag—and\ntook herself to task, poor thing! for a thousand imaginary\nfaults, and went about her household duties with swollen eyelids\nthe next morning.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Before the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this\nlast temptation, he was conscious of another impulse, more\nludicrous, and almost as horrible.  It was—we blush to tell\nit—it was to stop short in the road, and teach some very wicked\nwords to a knot of little Puritan children who were playing\nthere, and had but just begun to talk.  Denying himself this\nfreak, as unworthy of his cloth, he met a drunken seaman, one of\nthe ship's crew from the Spanish Main.  And here, since he had so\nvaliantly forborne all other wickedness, poor</p>",
  "page-458": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Mr. Dimmesdale\nlonged at least to shake hands with the tarry black-guard, and\nrecreate himself with a few improper jests, such as dissolute\nsailors so abound with, and a volley of good, round, solid,\nsatisfactory, and heaven-defying oaths!  It was not so much a\nbetter principle, as partly his natural good taste, and still\nmore his buckramed habit of clerical decorum, that carried him\nsafely through the latter crisis.</p><p>\"What is it that haunts and tempts me thus?\" cried the minister\nto himself, at length, pausing in the street, and striking his\nhand against his forehead.</p><p>\"Am I mad?  or am I given over utterly to the fiend?  Did I make\na contract with him in the forest, and sign it with my blood?\nAnd does he now summon me to its fulfilment, by suggesting the\nperformance of every wickedness which his most foul imagination\ncan conceive?\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At the moment when the Reverend Mr.</p>",
  "page-459": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Dimmesdale thus communed\nwith himself, and struck his forehead with his hand, old\nMistress Hibbins, the reputed witch-lady, is said to have been\npassing by.

Whether the witch had\nread the minister's thoughts or no, she came to a full stop,\nlooked shrewdly into his face, smiled craftily, and—though\nlittle given to converse with clergymen—began a conversation.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"So, reverend sir, you have made a visit into the forest,\"\nobserved the witch-lady, nodding her high head-dress at him.\n\"The next time I pray you to allow me only a fair warning, and I\nshall be proud to bear you company.

I went not into the forest to seek a potentate,\nneither do I, at any future time, design a visit thither, with a\nview to gaining the favour of such personage.

He\nentered the accustomed room, and looked around him on its books,\nits windows, its fireplace, and the tapestried comfort of the\nwalls, with the same perception of strangeness that had haunted\nhim throughout his walk from the forest dell into the town and\nthitherward.

But, in spite of this outward show, the latter was\nalmost convinced of the old man's knowledge, or, at least, his\nconfident suspicion, with respect to his own interview with\nHester Prynne.  The physician knew then that in the minister's\nregard he was no longer a trusted friend, but his bitterest\nenemy.  So much being known, it would appear natural that a part\nof it should be expressed.  It is singular, however, how long a\ntime often passes before words embody things; and with what\nsecurity two persons, who choose to avoid a certain subject, may\napproach its very verge, and retire without disturbing it.  Thus\nthe minister felt no apprehension that Roger Chillingworth would\ntouch, in express words, upon the real position which they\nsustained towards one another.  Yet did the physician, in his\ndark way, creep frightfully near the secret.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"Were it not better,\" said he, \"that you use my poor</p>",

The high estimation then placed upon the\nmilitary character might be seen in the lofty port of each\nindividual member of the company.  Some of them, indeed, by their\nservices in the Low Countries and on other fields of European\nwarfare, had fairly won their title to assume the name and pomp\nof soldiership.

Now she caught the low undertone, as of the\nwind sinking down to repose itself; then ascended with it, as it\nrose through progressive gradations of sweetness and power,\nuntil its volume seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of awe\nand solemn grandeur.

What was it?  The complaint of a human heart,\nsorrow-laden, perchance guilty, telling its secret, whether of\nguilt or sorrow, to the great heart of mankind; beseeching its\nsympathy or forgiveness,—at every moment,—in each accent,—and\nnever in vain!

If the minister's voice had not kept her there,\nthere would, nevertheless, have been an inevitable magnetism in\nthat spot, whence she dated the first hour of her life of\nignominy.

She\nran and looked the wild Indian in the face, and he grew\nconscious of a nature wilder than his own.  Thence, with native\naudacity, but still with a reserve as characteristic, she flew\ninto the midst of a group of mariners, the swarthy-cheeked wild\nmen of the ocean, as the Indians were of the land; and they\ngazed wonderingly and admiringly at Pearl, as if a flake of</p>",

At that\ndistance they accordingly stood, fixed there by the centrifugal\nforce of the repugnance which the mystic symbol inspired.

Then, down he sank upon the scaffold!  Hester partly\nraised him, and supported his head against her bosom.

  "page-534": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">the\nReverend Mr. Dimmesdale, on the very day when Hester Prynne\nfirst wore her ignominious badge, had begun a course of\npenance—which he afterwards, in so many futile methods,\nfollowed out—by inflicting a hideous torture on himself.  Others\ncontended that the stigma had not been produced until a long\ntime subsequent, when old Roger Chillingworth, being a potent\nnecromancer, had caused it to appear, through the agency of\nmagic and poisonous drugs.  Others, again and those best able to\nappreciate the minister's peculiar sensibility, and the\nwonderful operation of his spirit upon the body—whispered their\nbelief, that the awful symbol was the effect of the ever-active\ntooth of remorse, gnawing from the inmost heart outwardly, and\nat last manifesting Heaven's dreadful judgment by the visible\npresence of the letter.

Neither, by their report, had his dying words\nacknowledged, nor even remotely implied, any—the\nslightest—connexion on his part, with the guilt for which\nHester Prynne had so long worn the scarlet letter.  According to\nthese highly-respectable witnesses, the minister, conscious that\nhe was dying—conscious, also, that the reverence of the\nmultitude placed him already among saints and angels—had\ndesired, by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen\nwoman, to express to the world how utterly nugatory is</p>",
  "page-536": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\nchoicest of man's own righteousness.  After exhausting life in\nhis efforts for mankind's spiritual good, he had made the manner\nof his death a parable, in order to impress on his admirers the\nmighty and mournful lesson, that, in the view of Infinite\nPurity, we are sinners all alike.  It was to teach them, that the\nholiest amongst us has but attained so far above his fellows as\nto discern more clearly the Mercy which looks down, and\nrepudiate more utterly the phantom of human merit, which would\nlook aspiringly upward.  Without disputing a truth so momentous,\nwe must be allowed to consider this version of Mr. Dimmesdale's\nstory as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with which a\nman's friends—and especially a clergyman's—will sometimes\nuphold his character, when proofs, clear as the mid-day sunshine\non the scarlet letter, establish him a false and sin-stained\ncreature of the dust.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The authority which we have chiefly followed—a</p>",

All his strength and energy—all his vital and\nintellectual force—seemed at once to desert him, insomuch that\nhe positively withered up, shrivelled away and almost vanished\nfrom mortal sight, like an uprooted weed that</p>",
  "page-538": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">lies wilting in\nthe sun.  This unhappy man had made the very principle of his\nlife to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of\nrevenge; and when, by its completest triumph consummation that\nevil principle was left with no further material to support\nit—when, in short, there was no more Devil's work on earth for\nhim to do, it only remained for the unhumanised mortal to betake\nhimself whither his master would find him tasks enough, and pay\nhim his wages duly.  But, to all these shadowy beings, so long\nour near acquaintances—as well Roger Chillingworth as his\ncompanions we would fain be merciful.  It is a curious subject of\nobservation and inquiry, whether hatred and love be not the same\nthing at bottom.  Each, in its utmost development, supposes a\nhigh degree of intimacy and heart-knowledge; each renders one\nindividual dependent for the food of his affections and\nspiritual fife upon another: each leaves the passionate</p>",
  "page-539": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">lover,\nor the no less passionate hater, forlorn and desolate by the\nwithdrawal of his subject.  Philosophically considered,\ntherefore, the two passions seem essentially the same, except\nthat one happens to be seen in a celestial radiance, and the\nother in a dusky and lurid glow.  In the spiritual world, the old\nphysician and the minister—mutual victims as they have\nbeen—may, unawares, have found their earthly stock of hatred\nand antipathy transmuted into golden love.</p><p>Leaving this discussion apart, we have a matter of business to\ncommunicate to the reader.  At old Roger Chillingworth's decease,\n(which took place within the year), and by his last will and\ntestament, of which Governor Bellingham and the Reverend Mr.\nWilson were executors, he bequeathed a very considerable amount\nof property, both here and in England to little Pearl, the\ndaughter of Hester Prynne.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So Pearl—the elf child—the demon offspring, as</p>",
  "page-540": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">some people up\nto that epoch persisted in considering her—became the richest\nheiress of her day in the New World.  Not improbably this\ncircumstance wrought a very material change in the public\nestimation; and had the mother and child remained here, little\nPearl at a marriageable period of life might have mingled her\nwild blood with the lineage of the devoutest Puritan among them\nall.  But, in no long time after the physician's death, the\nwearer of the scarlet letter disappeared, and Pearl along with\nher.  For many years, though a vague report would now and then\nfind its way across the sea—like a shapeless piece of driftwood\ntossed ashore with the initials of a name upon it—yet no\ntidings of them unquestionably authentic were received.  The\nstory of the scarlet letter grew into a legend.  Its spell,\nhowever, was still potent, and kept the scaffold awful where the\npoor minister had died, and likewise the cottage by the\nsea-shore where Hester Prynne had dwelt.  Near this</p>",
  "page-541": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">latter spot,\none afternoon some children were at play, when they beheld a\ntall woman in a gray robe approach the cottage-door.  In all\nthose years it had never once been opened; but either she\nunlocked it or the decaying wood and iron yielded to her hand,\nor she glided shadow-like through these impediments—and, at all\nevents, went in.</p><p>On the threshold she paused—turned partly round—for perchance\nthe idea of entering alone and all so changed, the home of so\nintense a former life, was more dreary and desolate than even\nshe could bear.

But where was little Pearl? If still alive she must now\nhave been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood.  None\nknew—nor ever learned with the fulness of perfect\ncertainty—whether the elf-child</p>",
  "page-542": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">had gone thus untimely to a\nmaiden grave; or whether her wild, rich nature had been softened\nand subdued and made capable of a woman's gentle happiness.  But\nthrough the remainder of Hester's life there were indications\nthat the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love\nand interest with some inhabitant of another land.  Letters came,\nwith armorial seals upon them, though of bearings unknown to\nEnglish heraldry.  In the cottage there were articles of comfort\nand luxury such as Hester never cared to use, but which only\nwealth could have purchased and affection have imagined for her.\nThere were trifles too, little ornaments, beautiful tokens of a\ncontinual remembrance, that must have been wrought by delicate\nfingers at the impulse of a fond heart.

She had returned, therefore, and resumed—of\nher own free will, for not the sternest magistrate of that iron\nperiod would have imposed it—resumed the symbol of which we\nhave related so dark a tale.  Never afterwards did it quit her\nbosom.  But, in the lapse of the toilsome, thoughtful, and\nself-devoted years that made up</p>",
  "page-544": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Hester's life, the scarlet\nletter ceased to be a stigma which attracted the world's scorn\nand bitterness, and became a type of something to be sorrowed\nover, and looked upon with awe, yet with reverence too.  And, as\nHester Prynne had no selfish ends, nor lived in any measure for\nher own profit and enjoyment, people brought all their sorrows\nand perplexities, and besought her counsel, as one who had\nherself gone through a mighty trouble.  Women, more\nespecially—in the continually recurring trials of wounded,\nwasted, wronged, misplaced, or erring and sinful passion—or\nwith the dreary burden of a heart unyielded, because unvalued\nand unsought came to Hester's cottage, demanding why they were\nso wretched, and what the remedy!  Hester comforted and\ncounselled them, as best she might.  She assured them, too, of\nher firm belief that, at some brighter period, when the world\nshould have grown ripe for it, in Heaven's own time, a new</p>",
  "page-545": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">truth\nwould be revealed, in order to establish the whole relation\nbetween man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happiness.\nEarlier in life, Hester had vainly imagined that she herself\nmight be the destined prophetess, but had long since recognised\nthe impossibility that any mission of divine and mysterious\ntruth should be confided to a woman stained with sin, bowed down\nwith shame, or even burdened with a life-long sorrow.  The angel\nand apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman, indeed,\nbut lofty, pure, and beautiful, and wise; moreover, not through\ndusky grief, but the ethereal medium of joy; and showing how\nsacred love should make us happy, by the truest test of a life\nsuccessful to such an end.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So said Hester Prynne, and glanced her sad eyes downward at the\nscarlet letter.
